#Q7.Raju got 6 and half apples from each of Raghu, Sheenu and Akash. He wants to know how many apples he has in total without adding them. Write a program which could help Raju in doing this.

apples_per_person = 6.5
number_of_people = 3
total_apples = apples_per_person * number_of_people
print("Raju has a total of", total_apples, "apples without adding them.")
